# MOS
Moment of symmetry algorithms - Erv Wilson

I'm studying microtonality on my free time and want to create a bunch of programs in order to explorate this exciting world. I begin by working on the T.Narushima's book cited below and try to code the materials studied in. I work with Python because it's the language I know the better and also because I work on sound with Pyo, the Python library for sound creation (see http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/pyodoc/ and https://github.com/belangeo/pyo). It's easy to create Python arrays and send them to Pyo to produce music.
